<p>HANNAH MILLS 
 
Dancing has been my passion for a long time, I recently achieved my grade 7 in 
ballet and have previously gained grade 6 in tap dancing. I enjoy dancing because it 
helps me get fit and allows me to hang around with my friends. I also like wearing 
the pretty costumes when we put on a performance. I also enjoy business 
administration. 
 
Education 
 
2000-2006: Putney Road Primary School 
Here I learnt how to read and write. I also made a lot of really good friends who 
I am still in touch with. 
 
2006-2011: Putney St. John’s School 
I really enjoyed secondary school, although I didn’t always get on with the teachers 
and in year 8 moved into a different tutor group.  
I gained my GCSE’s here, my favourite subjects were business studies and drama. 
I got 3 A’s, 2 B’s and 6 C’s. I was pleased with my performance as I didn’t 
always work that hard. 
 
2011-2013: South London College 
I decided to go to College rather than stay on at school in the Sixth Form as this is 
what most of my friends were doing. College was great as we used to get some free 
periods and we could sit in the canteen and play cards. 
I studied a BTEC Level 3 Diploma in Business, at times it was really difficult 
and I didn’t do that well in some of the coursework pieces. I got a Merit in the end 
though, which I was glad about. 
 
Work experience 
 
I don’t have much work experience because it’s been quite hard to find much. Last 
summer I worked for six weeks in my mum’s friends nursery  to help with holiday 
cover – I had quite a bit of responsibility with some of the office duties but I also 
really enjoyed it because during the breaks I could play with some of the kids that 
attended the nursery.  </p>
<p />
</div>
<div class="page"><p />
<p>The other staff were quite nice to me and I helped them out quite a lot with talking 
to the parents and helping with enquires as well as updating records and files and 
things. The nursery is also based round the corner from me so I was always 
punctual which I think the other staff liked as the previous member of staff there 
had always been late.  
 
Achievements 
 
I got elected to help with the prom at college, which was great as it meant I met my 
boyfriend as he was also elected to help. The dancing at prom was also really good 
as they played all my favourite songs and I was one of the best dancers. 
I got some silly award in year 11 which I have to show you if you like. 
I also got my grade 7 in ballet and grade 6 in tap (I am less good at tap) when I 
was still at school. I don’t do grades anymore because it was too expensive to take 
the exams but I still really enjoy dancing. 
 
Interests 
 
As mentioned above I really enjoy dancing and am also involved in the college 
dance society. Ideally I would like to be a dancer but I am also doing business 
administration as I also enjoy it and think it is important to have something to fall 
back on. Dancing also doesn’t pay that well unless you get a great job going on tour 
with someone like Beyonce or Lady Gaga. That would be my absolute dream but in 
the mean time I want an office job so I can save some money to go travelling.
